# SKILL: Automated Research Intelligence (Perplexity Strategy)

## 1. Skill Overview
This skill shifts research from a "manual task" to an "automated product." By leveraging Perplexity's "Spaces," "Recurring Tasks," and "Model Switching," you can build an infinite-capacity intelligence network that sells for recurring revenue.

## 2. Core Capabilities

### A. The "Spaces" Architecture
*   **Concept:** Organized verticals for specific monitoring (e.g., "Fintech Regulations," "Competitor Product Launches").
*   **Configuration:**
    *   **Context:** Upload relevant whitepapers/past reports.
    *   **Source Filtering:** Use specific domains (`site:competitor.com`) to ground truth.

### B. Recurring "Daybreak" Protocols
*   **Feature:** Set prompts to run automatically every day at 6:00 AM.
*   **Benefit:** Wake up to completed intelligence briefs instead of starting research from zero.
*   **Prompt Logic:**
    *   "Search for [TOPIC] updates from the last 24 hours (`after:YYYY-MM-DD`)."
    *   "Synthesize into a bulleted executive briefing."

### C. Model Routing Arbitrage
*   **Strategy:** Use the best model for the specific sub-task.
    *   **Claude:** For writing summaries and human-like synthesis.
    *   **Gemini/GPT-4:** For visual analysis or complex logical reasoning.

### D. Advanced Search Operators
| Operator | Function | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `site:` | Limit search to specific domain | `site:tesla.com press release` |
| `after:` | Limit to recent content | `after:2024-01-01` |
| `filetype:` | Find specific assets | `filetype:pdf "Q4 Report"` |

## 3. The "Research Arbitrage" Business Model
*   **Old Way:** Charge hourly for manual Google searching.
*   **New Way:** Charge a monthly retainer ($800-$3,000/mo) for "Competitive Intelligence."
*   **The Workflow:**
    1.  Setup Perplexity Space for Client's Niche.
    2.  Configure 3 Daily Recurring Tasks (Regulatory, Competitor, Trends).
    3.  Spend 15 mins/week curating the auto-generated reports into a PDF.
    4.  Deliver "Deep Insights" that look like they took a 5-person team.

## 4. Integration with Agents
*   **CFO Agent:** Autoschedule competitive financial benchmarking.
*   **Sales Agent:** Auto-run pre-call intel on every new lead in the CRM.
